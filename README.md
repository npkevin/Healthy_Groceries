# Health Groceries / Shopping List

## [Demo Here!](https://npkevin.github.io/Healthy_Groceries/)

This is a simple webapp I created to hang up in my kitchen (with a display). The app simply allows users to create multiple grocery lists (recipes) with a focus on health and nutrition.

Created with React and Nutritionix API.

Definition for the Firebase function in ```/src/Food/FoodSearch.js -> firebase.app().functions('us-east4').httpsCallable('searchInstantNX')```
is found in /functions/index.js. Please enter your own app app id/key from Nutritionix and implement this however you choose.
